# Funnel-Analysis

## Goal

The goal is to perform funnel analysis for an e-commerce website.
Typically, websites have a clear path to conversion: for instance, you land on the home page, then you search, select a product and buy it. At each of these steps, some users will drop off and leave the site. The sequence of pages that leads to conversion is called ‘funnel’ .

Data Science can have a tremendous impact on funnel optimization. 
Funnel analysis allows to understand where/when our users abandon the website. It gives crucial insights on user behavior and on ways to improve the user experience as well as it often allows to discover bugs.

## Challenge Description

You are looking at data from an e-commerce website. The site is very simple and has just 4 pages:
1. The first page is the home page. When you come to the site for the first time, you can only land on the home page as a first page.
2. From the home page, the user can perform a search and land on the search page.
3. From the search page, if the user clicks on a product, she will get to the payment page, where she is asked to provide payment information in order to buy that product.
4. If she does decide to buy, she ends up on the confirmation page
