# Funnel-Analysis

## Goal

The goal is to perform funnel analysis for an e-commerce website.
Typically, websites have a clear path to conversion: for instance, you land on the home page, then you search, select a product and buy it. At each of these steps, some users will drop off and leave the site. The sequence of pages that leads to conversion is called ‘funnel’ .

Data Science can have a tremendous impact on funnel optimization. 
Funnel analysis allows to understand where/when our users abandon the website. It gives crucial insights on user behavior and on ways to improve the user experience as well as it often allows to discover bugs.
